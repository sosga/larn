# RL_M
I am the official maintainer of Larn.

This master branch is also Apache 2.0 Licensed.  The code of Larn has now been converted to C++17 and the vast majority of bugs have been squashed.

# Build Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atsb/RL_M.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atsb/RL_M)

# Compiling from Source
Compiling Larn from source will require GCC 7 as a minimum plus ncurses and jsoncpp.  See the 'build' folder for makefiles.

# Systems
I have standardized my setup and so the below are my ONLY targets for binaries and testing:

1. Illumos (UNIX) - 64bit only.
2. GNU/Linux - 64bit only.
3. macOS (UNIX).
4. Windows (MingW) - 64bit only.
